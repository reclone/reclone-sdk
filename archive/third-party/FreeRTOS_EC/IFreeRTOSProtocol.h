 * This interface provide the basic behavior for all class in the FreeRTOS Wrapper layer. All objects in this layer
 * must be able to manage the owned native FreeRTOS handle. When the handle is created  it is attached to the object.
 * From this moment the object owns the handle. When the object is disposed the handle is deleted and its resources
 * are freed. It is possible to keep the underling native FreeRTOS handle alive by detaching it before the owner
 * object is disposed.
