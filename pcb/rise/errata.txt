Reclone Rise - Errata Notes
---------------------------

Rev A - June 2017
- Use newer adjustable switching regulators
- Micro SD card holder is obsolete, use a more common/available footprint that's easier to solder
- Use a more available 3.5mm 4-conductor jack part number
- Mounting holes need wider tStop/bStop radius to match Pi
- Board is thicker than the Pi
- Switch to RTL8723BS module for WiFi/Bluetooth
- Turn boot jumper into shorting pads
- Use easier to solder RTC crystal

Rev C - Jan 2019
- Consider FPGA protection and/or level shifting for HDMI
- Right angle tact switch is annoying; get rid of it so that it's easier to reach reset button
- Hot-plugging USB devices causes inrush current that makes FTDI chip disconnect from host
  Use USB power switch AP2171D with discharge and 1.5A current limit
  Use BOOT1 pin for USB power enable
  Connect open-drain FLG pin to FPGA and to active-low LED
  Must limit input 5V capacitance to 10uF
- microUSB port shield should not be connected directly to ground.  Use 100nF cap instead.
- Revisit composite video lowpass filter
- Use 147/294 ohm resistors in R-2R DAC for voltage swing up to ~1.11V and precision of ~5IRE/bit
