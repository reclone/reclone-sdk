Rev A - June 2017
- Use newer adjustable switching regulators
- Micro SD card holder is obsolete, use a more common/available footprint that's easier to solder
- Use a more available 3.5mm 4-conductor jack part number
- Mounting holes need wider tStop/bStop radius to match Pi
- Board is thicker than the Pi
- Switch to RTL8723BS module for WiFi/Bluetooth
- Turn boot jumper into shorting pads
- Use easier to solder RTC crystal
