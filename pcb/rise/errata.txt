Reclone Rise - Errata Notes
---------------------------

Rev A - June 2017
- Use less crappy 1.8V switching regulator
- Should use PA2 and PA3 as the GPIO analog inputs, as they can double as an extra serial port (USART2)
- Micro SD card holder is obsolete, use a more common/available footprint that's easier to solder
- Use a more available 3.5mm 4-conductor jack part number
- Mounting holes need wider tStop/bStop radius to match Pi
- Board is thicker than the Pi
- Switch to RTL8723BS for WiFi/Bluetooth
- Turn boot jumper into shorting pads
- Length match the GPIO traces
- Add tStop/bStop and inner copper keepouts so that RGB LED shines through board
- Use easier to solder RTC crystal
