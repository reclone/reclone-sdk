The Reclone SDK contains open-source software from third parties.
Reclone Labs has gathered those works in compliance with each respective
open-source license.

Notable third-party software packages include:

*  FatFs - Generic FAT File System Module
   third-party/FatFS
   http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/en/appnote.html#license
   Basically equivalent to the BSD 1-Clause license

*  FreeRTOS
   third-party/FreeRTOS
   http://www.freertos.org/license.txt
   Note: GPLv2 with exception clauses allowing you to make a combined work
   including FreeRTOS, without releasing the combined work as GPL.

*  FreeRTOS Extension Classes
   third-party/FreeRTOS_EC
   https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0
   If you statically link with an LGPL library and do not release your derived work
   as GPL or LGPL, LGPL requires that you at least release the work in object 
   code form so that it can be re-linked to a new version of the LGPL'd library.
   Do not use FreeRTOS EC if you are not comfortable with that stipulation.

*  lwIP
   third-party/lwIP
   http://lwip.wikia.com/wiki/License
   Basically equivalent to the BSD 3-Clause license
   
*  PDCurses
   third-party/PDCurses
   http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/
   Public Domain
   
*  STM32CubeF4
   third-party/STM32CubeF4
   http://www.st.com/software_license_agreement_liberty_v2
   Note: "4. This software, including modifications and/or derivative works of 
   this software, must execute solely and exclusively on microcontroller or 
   microprocessor devices manufactured by or for STMicroelectronics."
   This is enforced through the use of static libraries.  The STM32CubeF4 
   static library shall not be included in binaries meant to run on a
   competitor's processor or microcontroller.
